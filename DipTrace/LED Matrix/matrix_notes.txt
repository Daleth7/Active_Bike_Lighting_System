LDO:
    - needs proper documentation (part name, manufacturer, datasheet link)
    - Missing bypass caps for LDO input and output
        * Please at least read the datasheet
    - missing pin names

CAV4109V-GT:
    - RefDes and Name markings need to be fixed
    - missing pin names
    - Bypass caps are backwards
        * Perhaps would not have happened if power and ground nodes were labelled

FDC6305N1:
    - Refdes and name markings need to be fixed
    - missing pin names

103669-1:
    - Refdes and name markings need to be fixed

LEDs:
    - need to be marked with part name, manufacturter, datasheet link
    - Will the chosen LEDs be able to handle 100 mA (according to CAV4109V-GT datasheet using 5.23kOhm)?

Resistors:
    - RefDes, Name and value markings on "5.23k" resistors need to be fixed
    - Current limiting resistors have no values
    - Ideally, should include datasheet links for exact resistors being used*

Nodes:
    - Important ones need to be named and labelled (5v, Gnd, etc.)
    - Ground line needs symbol


CAV4109V-GT is probably not suitable for this application (minimum 11.2-11.4 V source for LED string)
    - "The three LED pins are compatible with high voltage up to 25 V supporting applications with long strings of LEDs (pg 1, CAV4109V-GT datasheet)."
        * Indicates support for LED strings as long as appropriate voltage is supplied to turn on all LEDs
        * Internal FET at LED pins needs minimum 0.2 - 0.4 V to sink 100 mA (adds to required supply voltage)
    - If this driver is still desired, need to boost voltage supply:
