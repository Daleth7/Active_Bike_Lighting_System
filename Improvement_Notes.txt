Housing:
    - Make standoffs tall enough for capacitors on power module
        * Remember to move ports accordingly
    - Move cabling hole to be above the charger
    - Make sure microcontroller board sits above the charger
    - Use bullet connectors, so wires can be connected just outside the box
LED matrix:
    - Move power port to a more accessible location
    - Make a cutout for the radar (surround cutout with ground well)
Power Module:
    - Integrate with microcontroller PCB
    - Add to switching logic to isolate output when switch is open
    - Possibly create own charging circuit
